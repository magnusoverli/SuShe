# SuShe (SuperSheet)

SuShe is a very basic tool, aimed at creating rich and coherent "album-of-the-year" lists for personal use.

## Background

SuShe (SuperSheet) was born out of the need to standardize album-of-year award lists. Myself and a group of like minded people where arranging the annual Metal Awards, and saw the need to have the members' lists in a more standadrized form.
This lead to several tests with Excel and Google Sheets, but nothing quite fit the bill.
What we saw as the most pressing matter was agreeing on genres. A single album may have as many as 5-6 genres associated with them, and this made it hard to get lists where all albums where listed with the same genres.
Syntax for (complex) band names and album names was also a challenge, but less so.
In the end, I decided to try to build something custom made, and SuShe was born.
### Discalimer
**I am not a devloper!**
I can not code!

I understand just enough about coding to understand basic concepts and common pitfalls/challenges.

All code included in this repo is written by an AI tool on my order.

## What SuShe does

Basically, SuShe lets the user search (in the Spotify catalog) for an artist. You can now select an artist, which will list the albums for that artist, including year of release. Double clicking an album will add it to your list, and include the following info:
- Artist name
- Album name
- Date of release
- Cover art

The rest of the table includes columns for the following info to be added manually:
- Country
- Genre 1
- Genre 2
- Rating (0.00 - 5.00)
- Comment

## Contribution
Although I am very nervous about letting people see what I feel must be a mess of a project, I am welcoming the opportunity to let others potentially guide me and even contribute directly to the project. Please reach out, and don't be afraid to let me know just how much better something can be done! :-)
